In my project, I developed a secure login and signup system using SQL. I created a Users table to organize crucial user information, including user_id, username, and email, ensuring that all entries were distinct. During the signup phase, I inserted user data into the database to facilitate new account creation. For the login process, I retrieved user credentials and checked the entered password against the stored data. I also implemented prepared statements to protect against SQL injection attacks, highlighting the importance of maintaining data integrity and security while managing user information effectively.
